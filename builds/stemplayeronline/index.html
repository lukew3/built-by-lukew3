<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>When Kanye West started promoting his <a href="https://stemplayer.tech/">Stem Player device</a> and announced that his next album was going to be available only on that device, I became curious about how it worked, but not curious enough to order one for $200 USD. The features were simple enough that I figured that I could just program my own app version.</p>
<p>By the time I had the idea, somebody else had already made their own free web version (<a href="https://stemplayer.io">https://stemplayer.io</a>, but I wasn't happy with it. The audio would glitch out about 30 seconds in, the design was subpar, the animations clunky, and lacking more than half of the features of the device.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
