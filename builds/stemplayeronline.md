# Stem Player Online

## The Idea
When Kanye West started promoting his [Stem Player device](https://stemplayer.tech/) and announced that his next album was going to be available only on that device, I became curious about how it worked, but not curious enough to order one for $200 USD. The features were simple enough that I figured that I could just program my own app version.

By the time I had the idea, somebody else had already made their own free web version ([https://stemplayer.io](https://stemplayer.io), but I wasn't happy with it. The audio would glitch out about 30 seconds in, the design was subpar, the animations clunky, and lacking more than half of the features of the device. 

## Implementation
