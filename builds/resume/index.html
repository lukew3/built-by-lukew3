<p>The story of this project starts when I was looking for a good template for my resume. My first resumes were created in Microsoft Word/ Google Docs, but I soon realized that these resumes were visually unappealing and I wanted my resume to look like the cool latex ones that I had seen other people post online.</p>
<p>While searching for latex templates and latex resume builders, I found the website <a href="https://resumake.io">https://resumake.io</a>. The site is well-designed and a pleasure to use, and the fact that it's open-source made me like it even more. I loved the first template on their site. It was compact but neat enough that sections and items seperated themselves visually. I used the site for a couple of days and iteratively made improvements to my resume. I thought to myself that it would be nice to have a record of how my resume has changed over time. But pdfs are large and uploading a new pdf on every commit results in very large and hard to understand git commits. I noticed that resumake had an option to download the resume as LaTeX and an option to download as JSON. LaTeX would be a good option, but what about JSON?</p>
<p>I looked into the schema of the JSON file and tried searching to see if there was a standard schema for JSON resumes and sure enough found <a href="https://jsonresume.org">https://jsonresume.org</a>. I dug into the ecosystem of projects working with jsonresume, and thought that I saw a gap. There was not a project that simply took the data of a jsonresume file and inserted it into a latex document and created a pdf. Resumake did this, but requires users to use their web ui or drop in json and click some buttons to make it and generate a new pdf. I saw a perfect opportunity to use Github Actions.</p>
<p>Github Actions allows open-source repositories to run code on Github servers on certain Github events. In my case, when a user publishes a new version of their json resume, I wanted to tell Github Actions to fill a LaTeX template with the contents of my jsonresume and create a pdf of it. Github Actions work as a series of steps that the runner takes from the moment an action is triggered to when it is finished. Gihub has a marketplace for actions where I found an action that could <a href="https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action">build tex to pdf</a> and other actions for uploading files to a release, but I still needed an action that would populate a LaTeX file with the contents of a jsonresume.</p>
<p>I decided that the erb template style popularized by ruby on rails would be best suited for filling a LaTeX template because erb delimiters look most out of place in LaTeX code. Maybe I could have used another templating engine but changed the delimiters, but this was what I was familiar with and the Ruby code was a clean 4 lines. I figured that there might be a chance that somebody else would want to use this in their Github Actions, so I created a <a href="https://github.com/lukew3/json-fill-erb-action/tree/main">seperate repo for this function</a> and published it.</p>
<p>When making changes to the json directly, I realised that it was easy to make mistakes and not follow the jsonresume schema. I decided to make another action for doing this. Luckily jsonresume <a href="https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema">provides their own javascript package for validating the schema of a jsonresume</a> so all I had to do was create a wrapper workflow that ran their validation function on the json provided to a Github Action. You can see how I did this or use it yourself at <a href="https://github.com/lukew3/validate-json-resume-action">lukew3/valiate-json-resume-action</a>.</p>
<p>Plugging this all together made the experience of updating and keeping track of my resume versions extremely easy. Another thing that I am really happy about is that Github allows one link that always directs the follower to the latest download of the pdf, found at <a href="https://github.com/lukew3/resume/releases/latest/download/lukew3_resume.pdf">https://github.com/lukew3/resume/releases/latest/download/lukew3_resume.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>I love how this project works, and always share it with people who are interested in latex resumes because I think that it is a delight to use.</p>
